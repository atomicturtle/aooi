Atomic Offline Operating System Installer (AOOI) is a tool to install Linux on a system offline using either transient swap space, or over a network. 

It allows you to install, or reinstall Linux on an existing Linux or Windows system remotely. It will automatically partition the drives and install Linux non-interactively, and will reboot the system into a working installation.

This allows you to rebuild a Windows or Linux system into a working Linux installation remotely, without having local or console access to the system quickly and automatically.
